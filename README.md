# JavaScript Loose Comparison and Null Check Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving loose comparison (==) and null checks.  The bug arises from JavaScript's type coercion during loose comparisons, leading to unexpected behavior when handling null or undefined values.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to handle null values.  However, due to the use of loose comparison, the null check doesn't behave as expected in certain scenarios.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle null values by using strict equality (===).  Strict equality prevents type coercion, ensuring the null check is accurate and reliable.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` with different input values including null and other types to observe the unexpected behavior. 
3. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the correct implementation and expected output.

## Learning Points

* Always use strict equality (===) when comparing values in JavaScript, especially when dealing with null or undefined.
* Understand how JavaScript's type coercion works to avoid unexpected behavior.
